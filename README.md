Diabetes Prediction Project Notes:

Project Introduction:

Objective: Build a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on various health-related features.
Dataset: Utilized a dataset with 768 entries and 9 features, including 'Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', and 'Outcome'.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Checked for missing values (none found).
Explored the correlation between features using a heatmap.
Data Preprocessing:

Checked for and handled missing values:
Identified and handled missing values using SimpleImputer.
Investigated and addressed features with zero values:
'Glucose' had 5 missing values.
'BloodPressure' had 35 missing values.
'Insulin' had 374 missing values.
'BMI' had 11 missing values.
'SkinThickness' had 227 missing values.
Data Splitting:

Used the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing sets.
Chose relevant feature columns ('Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age') and predicted class ('Outcome').
Modeling - Random Forest:

Applied a RandomForestClassifier initially without hyperparameter tuning.
Explored feature importance using correlation matrices.
Modeling - XGBoost:

Applied XGBoost Classifier for improved model performance.
Defined hyperparameter search space using parameters like learning rate, max depth, min child weight, gamma, and colsample by tree.
Utilized RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
Obtained the best estimator with optimal hyperparameters.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the XGBoost model using cross-validation with 10 folds.
Considered accuracy as the primary metric.
Calculated the mean accuracy across folds.
Results and Conclusion:

Achieved a mean cross-validation accuracy of approximately 73.7% with the tuned XGBoost model.
Noted potential areas for improvement, including further exploration of other metrics and comparing with alternative models (e.g., RandomForest).
Future Steps:

Consider additional feature engineering or data preprocessing techniques.
Explore other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Fine-tune the model further based on domain knowledge or additional insights.
Evaluate the model on an independent test set for final performance assessment.
Code Cleanliness:

Reviewed and cleaned up code for better readability.
Fixed minor typos or duplicate lines.
This summary provides a high-level overview of your diabetes prediction project, covering the main steps from data exploration to model evaluation. Depending on your project's specific goals, you may want to tailor these notes further or include additional details.
